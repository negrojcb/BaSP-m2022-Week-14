Initiate a WebdriverIO Setup
To add a full WebdriverIO setup to an existing or new project using the WebdriverIO Starter Toolkit, run:

Using NPM

If you're in the root directory of an existing project, run:

*npm init wdio .*

or if you want to create a new project:

*npm init wdio ./path/to/new/project*

Using Yarn

If you're in the root directory of an existing project, run:

*yarn create wdio .*

or if you want to create a new project:

*yarn create wdio ./path/to/new/project*

This single command downloads the WebdriverIO CLI tool and runs a configuration wizard that helps you to configure your test suite.
